`bayesnecsdtools` is a Shiny application for fitting concentration response curves and estimating no effect concentrations using [`bayesnec`](https://github.com/open-aims/bayesnec).

## Utilization

The most recent version is available online at <https://open-aims.shinyapps.io/bayesnec/>.

To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/open-aims/shinybayesnec) and deploy locally use

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("open-aims/shinybayesnec")
library(shinybayesnec)
shinybayesnec::run_app()
```

## Features

In addition to being a Graphical User Interface to the core functionality in the [`bayesnec`](https://github.com/open-aims/bayesnec) package, `shinybayesnec` also provides 

- generation of R scripts for reproducibility;
- customization and downloads of plots and tables

## Assistance

To report bugs/issues/feature requests, please file an [issue](https://github.com/open-aims/shinybayesnec/issues/).

## Deploying to shinyapps.io

### Manually

Run the `deploy-app.R` script in the scripts directory (after setting the account argument to be your `shinyapps.io` account name).

### Automatically

If your `shinyapps.io` account name is the same as your GitHub account name simply make a commit in the master or dev branch and include `deploy app` in the message 
(after setting `SHINYAPPS_TOKEN` and `SHINYAPPS_SECRET` in your repository GitHub secrets). 
This triggers the `deploy-app.yml` GitHub action.
